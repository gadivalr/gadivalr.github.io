A PID controller is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems.

## What is a PID controller?

A PID controller calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable.

- **P**: Proportional
- **I**: Integral
- **D**: Derivative

## Practical tuning tips

1. Start with only the proportional term.
2. Add integral to eliminate steady-state error.
3. Add derivative to reduce overshoot.

> Experiment and observe the system response for best results.
